Then you want to make sure you have downloaded all the dependencies used for this project,

```bash
yarn
```

Then you will need to fetch required graphql schema and generate `react-query` hooks with:

```bash
yarn codegen
```

Then you can start the app simply by:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## üÖ±Ô∏è How to start storybook?

Alright, we have support for storybook now!

To load the storybook when you are in developmetn mode, you can run the following command to spin up a storybook server at port 6006

```sh
yarn storybook
```

To build a static storybook website, you can run the following command

```sh
yarn build-storybook
```

## üß™ How to test this app?

Simple! Just run this and you are good to go!

```bash
yarn test
```

To run e2e test with cypress, if you have the next server spinning already, then you can just run.

```bash
yarn e2e
# cypress run
```

However, there's also a command that allows you to start the server and run test at once.

```bash
yarn e2e:start-server
# start-server-and-test dev 3000 cypress run
```
